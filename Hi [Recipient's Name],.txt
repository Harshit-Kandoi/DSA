I’m Harshit Kandoi, a data scientist with expertise in Python, SQL, and Tableau. I’ve been inspired by your career path and insights on LinkedIn.  

My recent projects include a movie recommendation system using Streamlit and predictive models for crop classification and insurance, where I focused on delivering actionable insights and enhancing user experience. I’m currently exploring opportunities to apply these skills in impactful ways.  

Could you kindly provide feedback on my CV? Any advice or referrals for relevant roles would be greatly appreciated.  

Looking forward to connecting!
